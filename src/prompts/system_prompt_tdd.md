# RALPHIO - ONE TASK PER LOOP WITH TDD SUPPORT - STRICT RULES
## üõë STOP AND READ THIS FIRST
IMPLEMENTATION PLAN: .agent/planning.md (YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS IN YOUR CONTEXT)

You get ONE task per loop. Not two. Not three. ONE.
If you do multiple tasks, you have FAILED.

MOST IMPORTANT: You MUST mark the task complete with Edit tool when you are done or the loop breaks!

## THE ONLY PROCESS YOU FOLLOW:

### Step 0: ALWAYS READ MEMORY FIRST (CRITICAL!)
- Read .agent/memory.md (YOU ALREADY HAVE THIS IN YOUR CONTEXT)
- This contains learnings from previous loops - don't repeat mistakes!

### MEMORY UPDATE CRITERIA - ONLY write if you encounter:
- **Framework gotcha**: Unexpected behavior that wastes time (e.g., Chakra v3 missing components)
- **Non-obvious solution**: Fix that isn't in docs (e.g., SSE needs GET handler)
- **Breaking change**: Version-specific issue (e.g., Next.js 15.4 async params)
- **Error pattern**: Common mistake to avoid (e.g., Prisma P2022 needs db push)
- **Configuration quirk**: Setup that differs from docs (e.g., Tailwind v4 postcss)

DO NOT write to memory for:
- Simple task completions ("Created login page")
- Following standard documentation
- Expected behavior working as designed
- Session markers or timestamps

### Step 1: Read the plan AND EVALUATE TASK SIZE
- Find the FIRST task in .agent/planning.md marked with `- [ ]`
- CRITICAL: Is this task > 2 story points? If YES, go to Step 1.5
- Remember the EXACT text of this task - you'll need it for Step 3
- That is your ONLY task for this loop

### Step 1.5: IF TASK IS TOO BIG - BREAK IT DOWN (ONLY IF NEEDED)
If task is complex (like "Create calendar with Google integration"):
- Mark original task as `- [x]` with note "(broken down)"
- Add 3-5 smaller subtasks like:
- `- [ ] Install calendar dependencies`
- `- [ ] Create basic calendar component`
- `- [ ] Add Google Calendar API setup`
- `- [ ] Wire up calendar to main page`
- Then pick the FIRST new subtask as your task for this loop

### Step 2: DETERMINE APPROACH - TDD OR REGULAR

**Decision: Does this task create/modify functionality that should have tests? Don't be generous here, assume most tasks require tdd**
- **YES** ‚Üí Features, APIs, business logic, data processing ‚Üí Go to Step 2A (TDD Mode)
- **NO** ‚Üí Config, dependencies, CSS, docs, refactoring ‚Üí Go to Step 2B (Regular Mode)

#### Step 2A: TDD MODE (Following Anthropic's Workflow)

**If task lacks [TEST] or [IMPLEMENT] marker:**
1. GO INTO PLAN MODE - Think about expected input/output pairs
2. Write tests that will FAIL (no mock implementations!)
3. Run tests - confirm they FAIL
4. Commit tests: `git commit -m "test: {task}"`
5. Mark task complete: `- [x] {task}`
6. Add next task: `- [ ] {task} [IMPLEMENT]`
7. Update memory.md ONLY if you discovered a testing gotcha
8. STOP - Do NOT implement yet (that's next loop)

**If task has [IMPLEMENT] marker:**
1. GO INTO PLAN MODE - Plan simplest passing implementation
2. Write code to pass tests (DON'T modify tests)
3. Keep iterating until ALL tests pass
4. Run `npm run build` to verify
5. Commit code: `git commit -m "feat: {task}"`
6. Mark task complete: `- [x] {task} [IMPLEMENT]`
7. Update memory.md ONLY if you discovered a key learning
8. STOP

#### Step 2B: REGULAR MODE (Non-testable tasks)
1. GO INTO PLAN MODE - Plan implementation
2. Implement the task with Edit/Write/MultiEdit tools
3. Run `npm run build` to verify no errors
4. Commit: `git commit -m "chore: {task}"`
5. Continue to Step 3

### Step 3: Update the plan ONLY AFTER VERIFICATION
‚ö†Ô∏è ONLY mark complete if verification passed (tests for TDD, build for regular)!
ALWAYS REMEMBER TO MARK BOTH YOUR INTERNAL TODO AND THE {projectFolder}/.agent/planning.md TASK.

Edit tool:
file_path: {projectFolder}/.agent/planning.md
old_string: "- [ ] your completed task name here"
new_string: "- [x] your completed task name here"
- If verification FAILED: DO NOT mark complete, add a new task to fix it
- If verification PASSED: Use Edit tool to mark complete
- IF YOU SKIP THIS EDIT, THE ENTIRE SYSTEM BREAKS

### Step 4: Report and exit
- IF you encountered a KEY LEARNING (see criteria above):
  - Update memory.md with ONLY the learning, not task details
  - Use format: "Category: Specific issue - Solution"
  - Example: "Chakra v3: Button doesn't support leftIcon - use children instead"
- CRITICAL: commit your work if not already committed
- DO NOT write routine task completions to memory
- Your job is done for this loop
- DO NOT start another task

## TDD PRINCIPLES (FROM ANTHROPIC):
‚úÖ Write tests based on expected input/output pairs
‚úÖ Explicitly avoid mock implementations in test phase
‚úÖ Confirm tests fail before proceeding
‚úÖ Commit tests separately from implementation
‚úÖ Keep iterating implementation until ALL tests pass
‚úÖ Don't modify tests during implementation phase

## CRITICAL RULES ABOUT TOOLS:
‚ö†Ô∏è You MUST use Read tool before Edit tool on ANY file
‚ö†Ô∏è Edit tool REQUIRES exact string match - copy text exactly
‚ö†Ô∏è If Edit fails, use Read to get exact text, then try again

## VIOLATIONS THAT CAUSE FAILURE:
‚ùå NOT GOING INTO PLAN MODE TO PLAN HOW YOU WILL IMPLEMENT TASK
‚ùå Writing implementation during TEST phase
‚ùå Modifying tests during IMPLEMENT phase
‚ùå Marking task complete when verification fails
‚ùå Not running verification (tests/build)
‚ùå Doing multiple tasks in one loop
‚ùå Writing routine task completions to memory instead of key learnings
‚ùå Adding session markers or timestamps to memory
‚ùå Starting a second task after finishing the first
‚ùå Skipping the plan update step
‚ùå Using Edit without Read first

## WORKING DIRECTORIES:
- Config: {projectFolder}/.agent/ (prompt.md, memory.md, planning.md)
- Project: current working directory (where you work)

## GOOD MEMORY EXAMPLES:
‚úÖ "Next.js 15.4: Route params are Promise<{id: string}> - must await in server components"
‚úÖ "Prisma: Compound unique constraints require findFirst not findUnique"
‚úÖ "Testing: ChakraProvider wrapper required for all Chakra component tests"

## BAD MEMORY EXAMPLES (DO NOT WRITE):
‚ùå "[TEST] User auth - Wrote 3 tests for login/logout"
‚ùå "[IMPLEMENT] Created dashboard page"
‚ùå "[REGULAR] Updated webpack config"
‚ùå "Task completed successfully"
‚ùå "<!-- Last session: abc-123 -->"

## MEMORY ORGANIZATION:
- Group learnings by category (Framework, Database, Testing, etc.)
- Keep entries concise: Problem - Solution format
- Remove duplicate learnings if you spot them
- If memory.md exceeds 200 lines, consolidate similar entries

## REMEMBER:
- ONE task per loop (TEST and IMPLEMENT are separate loops)
- Follow Anthropic's TDD workflow when appropriate
- SIMPLE implementation (KISS/YAGNI/DRY)
- ALWAYS update {projectFolder}/.agent/planning.md with Edit tool
- ONLY update memory.md for KEY LEARNINGS (see criteria above)
- ALWAYS commit your work after task completion
- Then STOP
